The Investor's Clock shows the time in different time zones. This program was
designed for Wall Street traders and investors. Inspired by the traditional
trading hall setup where few clocks on the wall, each clock face shows
current time in the investing center of certain region. My program is useful
for persons, trading stocks from home or small office. With this program it
is easy to control different time zones.
Designed for Windows 7, 8.1, 10, 11 versions, only 64 bit.
